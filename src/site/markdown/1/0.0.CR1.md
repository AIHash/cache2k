## New and Noteworthy

- Thread pools configurable for loading and prefetching. `Cache2kBuilder#loaderExecutor`, `Cache2kBuilder#prefetchExecutor`
- Various API cleanup.

## Potential breakages

- `sharpExpiry(true)` only has effect on times returned by `ExpiryPolicy` 
- `eternal(false)` has an effect now and means "needs expiry, but expiry is undefined yet.".
   This can be used to ensure that an expiry time is set via the configuration.
- Setting conflicting parameters like `eternal(true)` and `expireAfterWrite(...)` leads to an exception
- Attempts to create a cache with the identical name of an active cache yields a `IllegalArgumentException`.
  (In the release before the cache name was disambiguated by adding a incrementing number)


## Improvements

- remove task queue for asynchronous loads/refreshs and handle rejections gracefully
- reduce default loader thread count to one per available CPU
- `toString()` contains cache manager name
- `toString()` add version number
