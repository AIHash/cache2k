## Potential breakages

- `sharpExpiry(true)` only has effect on times returned by `ExpiryPolicy` 
- `eternal(false)` has an effect now and means "needs expiry, but expiry is undefined yet.".
   This can be used to ensure that an expiry time is set via the configuration.
- Setting conflicting parameters like `eternal(true)` and `expireAfterWrite(...)` leads to an exception

## New and Noteworthy

- Thread pools configurable for loading and prefetching. `Cache2kBuilder#loaderExecutor`, `Cache2kBuilder#prefetchExecutor`

## Improvements

- remove task queue for asynchronous loads/refreshs and handle rejections gracefully
