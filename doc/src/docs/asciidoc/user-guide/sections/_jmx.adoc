== JMX

=== Containers, ClassLoaders and CacheManager names

The JMX objects are registered at the platform MBean manager. This requires that the cache manager
name is unique within the platform, even if there is a separation by different class loaders.
A good practise to avoid problems, is to set the cache manager name to a unique name for an application.
The name of the default manager can be changed via JNDI, `CacheManager.setDefaultName()` or
the XML configuration.

=== Name quoting

Cache and manager names may contain the comma character. If a comma is contained, then it will be quoted
in the JMX value. Quoted and unquoted values for the same key is undesirable, so a comma character should
be avoided in a cache name.
